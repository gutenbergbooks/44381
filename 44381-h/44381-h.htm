<p class="p4">[The original of this manuscript is deposited in the French war archives,
in Paris; a copy was, with the permission of the French Government, taken in
1855, and deposited in the Library of the Legislative Assembly of Canada.
The Literary and Historical Society of Quebec, through the kindness of Mr.
Todd, the Librarian, was permitted to have communication thereof. This
document is supposed to have been written about the year 1765, that is five
years after the return to France from Canada of the writer, the Chevalier
Johnstone, a Scottish Jacobite, who had fled to France after the defeat at
Culloden, and obtained from the French monarch, with several other
Scotchmen, commissions in the French armies. In 1748, says <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Francisque
Michel</i>,<a name="FNanchor_A" id="FNanchor_A" href="#Footnote_A" class="fnanchor">A</a> “he sailed from Rochefort as an Ensign with troops going to Cape
Breton; he continued to serve in America until he returned to France, in
December, 1760, having acted during the campaign of 1759, in Canada, as
aide-de-camp to Chevalier de Levis. On Levis being ordered to Montreal,
Johnstone was detached and retained by General Montcalm on his staff, on
account of his thorough knowledge of the environs of Quebec, and particularly
of Beauport, where the principal works of defence stood, and where the whole
army, some 11,000 men, were entrenched, leaving in Quebec merely a garrison
of 1500. The journal is written in English, and is not remarkable for
orthography or purity of diction; either Johnstone had forgotten or had never
thoroughly known the language. The style is prolix, sententious, abounding
in quotations from old writers. This document had first attracted the
attention of one of the late historians of Canada, the Abbé Ferland, who
attached much importance to it, as calculated to supply matters of detail and
incidents unrecorded elsewhere. Colonel Margry, in charge of the French
records, had permitted the venerable writer, then on a visit to Paris, to make
extracts from it; some of which extracts, the abbé published at the time of
the laying of the St. Foy Monument, in 1862. The Chevalier Johnstone differs
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">in toto</i> from the opinions expressed by several French officers of regulars,
respecting the conduct of the Canadian Militia, in 1759, ascribing to their
valour, on the 13th September, the salvation of a large portion of the French
army. He has chosen the singular, though not unprecedented mode of the
Dialogue, to recapitulate the events of a campaign in which he played a not
inconsiderable part.”&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;<span class="smcap">J.&nbsp;M. LeMoine.]</span>

<h2>A DIALOGUE IN HADES.<br />

<span class="subhead">A PARALLEL OF MILITARY ERRORS, OF WHICH THE FRENCH
AND ENGLISH ARMIES WERE GUILTY, DURING THE
CAMPAIGN OF 1759, IN CANADA.</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The Marquis de Montcalm</span>:&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;Having ardently
desired a conversation with you, sir, upon the operations of
a campaign which proved to both of us so fatal, I have
sought you continually amongst the shades ever since I
descended here, where I soon followed you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">General Wolfe</span>:&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;I can assure you, sir, I was equally
impatient to meet with you. Some of my countrymen,
arrived here since the battle of the 13th September, informed
me that there was only an interval of a few hours in our
sharing the same hard fate. They gave me some accounts
of that event which joined Canada to the British
dominions; but as they had a very imperfect knowledge of
the circumstances, and entirely ignorant of your plan of
operations, I have little information from them, and I am
heartily glad that chance at last has procured me the
pleasure of seeing you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Montcalm</span>:&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;Will you permit me, sir, before our conversation
becomes serious, to offer some reflections upon
the difference in our destiny. Your nation rendered you
the greatest honours; your body was conveyed to
London, and buried there magnificently in Westminster
Abbey, amongst your kings. Generous Britons erected
to your memory a superb monument over your grave, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
public expense; and your name, most dear to your countrymen,
is ever in their mouths, accompanied with praise and
regret. But in my country what a strange indifference?
What sensation did my death make upon my compatriots?
My conduct denounced and censured without measure, is
the continual subject of conversation for gossiping fools
and knaves, who form the majority in all communities, and
prevail against the infinitely small number to be found of
honest, judicious, impartial men, capable of reflection. The
Canadians and savages who knew the uprightness of my
soul, ever devoted to the interests of my beloved king and
country, they alone rendered me justice, with a few sincere
friends, who, not daring to oppose themselves openly to
the torrent of my enemies, bewailed in secret my unhappy
fate, and shed on my tomb their friendly tears.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wolfe</span>:&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;In this blessed abode, inaccessible to prejudice,
I vow to you, sir, I envy your condition, notwithstanding
the horrible injustice and ingratitude of your countrymen.
What can give more pleasure and self-satisfaction than the
esteem and approbation of honest men? You were
severely regretted and lamented by all those who were
capable of discerning and appreciating your superior merit,
talents, and eminent qualities. Disinterested persons of
probity must respect your virtue. All officers versed in
the art of war will justify your military tactics, and your
operations can be blamed only by the ignorant. Were my
army consulted, they would be as many witnesses in your
favour. Your humanity towards prisoners won you the
heart of all my soldiers. They saw with gratitude and
veneration your continual care and vigilance to snatch
them from out of the hands of the Indians, when those
barbarians were ready to cut their throats, and prepared to
make of human flesh their horrible banquets; refusing me
even tears at my death, they weeped and bewailed your
hard fate; I see in my mausoleum the proof only of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
human weakness! What does that block of marble avail
to me in my present state? The monument remains, but
the conqueror has perished. The affection, approbation
and regret of the worthiest part of mankind is greatly
preferable and much above the vain honours conferred by
a blind people, who judge according to the event, and are
incapable to analyse the operations. I was unknown to
them before the expedition which I commanded in Canada;
and if fortune, to whom I entirely owe my success, had
less favoured me, perhaps, like Byng, I would have been
the victim of a furious and unruly populace. The
multitude has and can have success only for the rule of
their judgment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Montcalm</span>:&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;I am much obliged to you, sir, for your
favourable opinion of me. Let us leave weak mortals to
crawl from error to error, and deify to-day what they will
condemn to-morrow. It is at present, when the darkness
is dispelled from before our eyes, that we can contemplate
at leisure the passions of men, who move as the waves of
the sea, push on each other and often break upon the
rocks; and in our present state, when all prejudices are at
an end, let us examine impartially the operations of 1759,
which was the epocha of the loss to France of her northern
colonies in America.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wolfe</span>:&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;Most willingly, sir, and to show my
frankness, I own to you I was greatly surprised on arriving
with the English fleet at Quebec without meeting with
any opposition by the French in the river St. Lawrence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Montcalm</span>:&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;You had reason to be so. It was not
my fault that you did not meet with many obstacles in
your way. I proposed to have a redoubt and battery erected
upon Cape Tourmente, which is a rock above fifty feet
high, facing the Traverse at the <span class="locked">east<a name="FNanchor_B" id="FNanchor_B" href="#Footnote_B" class="fnanchor">B</a></span> end of the Island of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
Orleans, where all the vessels cross from the north to the
south side of the St. Lawrence river. They are obliged to
approach very near the Cape before they enter into the
Traverse, and its height above the men-of-war would have
secured it against the effect of the artillery. Besides, this
rock, almost perpendicular, commanding all round it, the
fort would have been impregnable, and not susceptible of
being besieged. Thus the first of your ships which
approached to pass the Traverse would have been raked
by the plunging fire of the battery from stern to bowsprit,
and must have been sunk. I had likewise the project of
placing a battery and a redoubt upon the upper point of
the bay which is opposite to the west end of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Isle aux
Coudres</i>. The current between this island and the main
land being incredibly rapid at low water, all the vessels
coming up the river must have cast anchor there to wait
until the next tide; and my artillery upon the point of
that bay would have battered your ships at anchor from
fore to aft; have put in a most terrible confusion your
ships, who could not have taken up their anchors without
being instantly dashed to pieces against the rocks by the
violence of the current, forced, as they would have been
by it, to have their bowsprits always pointed to the battery,
without being able to fire at it. Your fleet would have had
no knowledge of the battery until they were at anchor, so
you may easily judge how it would have distressed them.
I proposed this, but I did not command in chief; it was
the Marquis de Vaudreuil, Governor General of Canada,
who should have ordered it to be put into execution.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wolfe</span>:&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;If they had executed your project, it would
have puzzled us, and retarded for some time our
operations.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Montcalm</span>:&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;That was all I could wish for, as I was
always sensible of the great advantage, in certain
situations, of gaining time from the enemy, especially in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
such a climate as Canada, where the summer is so short
that it is impossible to keep the field longer than from the
month of May till the beginning of October, and your fleet
arrived at <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Isle aux Coudres</i> at the end of June.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wolfe</span>:&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;There is no doubt that you are in the right.
Our fleet arrived in the river St. Lawrence six weeks too
late, which is commonly the fate of all great naval expeditions.
Fleets are seldom ready to sail at the time appointed;
and this often renders fruitless the best concocted enterprise
by sea, from the uncertainty of the arrival of the army
at its destination. The smallest delay is often dangerous, as
it gives the enemy the time to prepare themselves for
defence, without hurry or confusion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Montcalm</span>:&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;I will not conceal from you, sir, that I
always looked upon the distribution you made of your army
upon your landing near Quebec, as diametrically opposed
to the established principles in castrametation. It is a
known axiom in the art of war, that an army ought to be
encamped in such a manner as to have a free and easy communication
with all its parts; that they may unite quickly
without any obstruction, and be able to defend and sustain
each other reciprocally over the whole extent of the camp,
in case any part of it is attacked. You divided your army
in three different camps; one of them upon the Pointe
Levis, another upon the Island of Orleans, and the third at
the Sault de Montmorency. The two branches of the St.
Lawrence river, which forms the Island of Orleans, each of
them about half a mile broad, separated your three camps,
without a possibility of establishing a communication
between them; and your camp upon the Pointe Levis was
at a distance of six miles from your camp at the Sault de
Montmorency. Your position was such that had we fallen
with our army on any of your three camps, we would have
cut them to pieces, before those of your other two camps
could have come to their assistance. The knowledge for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
choosing an advantageous ground for encamping an army,
always appears to me to be one of the most essential talents
requisite in a general. How could you remain quietly in
such a dangerous position during two months, without
trembling.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wolfe</span>:&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;What hindered you then, sir, from executing
that which appeared to you so easy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Montcalm</span>:&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;We attempted it, but with very bad success.
Seven days after your landing at the Pointe Levis,
Mr. Dumas, Major of the Colony troops, was sent to attack
your camp at the Pointe Levis, with a body of fifteen hundred
men, who, in the night, crossed the river St. Lawrence
at Quebec, without being discovered by your advanced
guards. But they were no sooner landed and marching,
than, struck with a panic, the utmost disorder suddenly
ensued; their heads turned, and, losing their senses entirely,
they fired at each other, believing themselves attacked
by your army. In short, they immediately fled back to
their boats with the greatest precipitation and confusion.
Discouraged by this bad beginning, M. de Vaudreuil would
never listen to any proposals of further attempts upon your
camps; and it was decided to keep ourselves for the future
upon the defensive.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wolfe</span>:&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;It appears to me, however, that you were
not encamped in a proper manner to be upon the defensive.
Your army did not amount to ten thousand men, and your
camp extended seven or eight miles.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Montcalm</span>:&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;I agree with you, and am sensible that
the longer the line, the weaker it is in its several parts. I
am convinced that it is impossible to prevent a line from
being forced; and I believed likewise that, landing on a
coast where there are several leagues of it to be defended,
equally susceptible of descent, is the same case as lines. He
who attacks has all his force concentrated at a single point,
which he may choose as he pleases; anywhere in the extent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
of his lines; on the contrary, he who is attacked in his
entrenchments has his force divided over the whole extent
of his lines, and does not know on what part of them the
enemy has the intention to make his real attack, so that he
must be everywhere equally strong and guarded over all
the ground occupied by his army. Thus the head of a
column of a great depth of ranks must infallibly pierce
through lines who have only at most two or three men
deep; and by feint attacks all over the front of a line, you
cannot weaken one part of it by drawing troops from it to
fortify another part of it, unless the point of the enemy’s
principal attack is manifestly known. It is certainly the
same with regard to landings, where all the extent of the
sea coast may be threatened at the same time, although it is
a common opinion that a coast may be defended, and that
an enemy may be repulsed in his attempt to make a descent
by open force.</p>

<p>I know not a better method to oppose a descent than to
have bodies of troops in battle, ready to rush upon the enemy,
with their bayonets upon their muskets, attacking the
moment the enemy land, whilst they are yet few and in confusion
from the disorder which must necessarily happen at
their coming out of their boats, and before they can present
a considerable front in battle.</p>

<p>My project of defence was to encamp on rising ground
at Quebec, called by the French, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Les Hauteurs d’Abraham</i>,
and make Quebec serve as the centre and pivot to all my
operations, since it was evident that the fate of Canada depended
entirely on its being preserved to us or taken by
you, which decided whether that colony should remain to
its ancient possessors or become your prize.</p>

<p>With this in view, I intrenched the borders of the St.
Charles river, and remained encamped at Quebec until, receiving
tidings of your fleet having arrived in the St. Lawrence
river, M. de Levis, an officer of great merit and distinction,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
proposed to change the position of our camp, by carrying
our left wing to the Sault de Montmorency, and our
right to the St. Charles river: this, as you say, made it six
miles long on the north side of Quebec, and gave us greater
appearance of being on the offensive than on the defensive.</p>

<p>He pretended that the presenting a great front to the
enemy would give us a bold look, and inspire respect. As
there can be no positive certainty in any military operation,
from unforeseen accidents which often overturn the best
combined project, I readily sacrificed to him my opinion,
without insisting upon it. In this new position M. de Vaudreuil
commanded the right of our camp, near Quebec; M. de
Levis the left, at the Sault de Montmorency; and I commanded
the centre, at Beauport.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wolfe</span>:&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;Had you continued on the heights of Abraham
you would have saved Quebec, but you would have abandoned
to me all the country where I might have destroyed,
burnt and ruined all the settlements at some leagues round
it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Montcalm</span>:&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;That may be, but Canada would not have
been taken, and certainly you durst not penetrate far into
the country, leaving Quebec behind you. Had you attacked me,
I would have had the advantage of the rising ground,
which I would have fortified with intrenchments, and with
a chain of redoubts from Quebec to Cap Rouge, where these
heights terminate in a deep ravine, with a small river at the
bottom of it, overhung with rocks, at three leagues from Quebec.
This advantageous position, not to be successfully attacked
by any number of men, would have been my advanced
post.</p>

<p>My right would have been applied to Quebec, and
sustained by it. I never could guess, sir, your idea in reducing
that town to ashes as you did, by throwing upon it
continually, from your batteries on the opposite side of the
river, that immense number of carcases and shells.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
It seems to me that when an army besieges a town, it
is with the intention, on its surrendering, to keep possession
of it, and have houses in it to lodge the troops, instead of
heaps of ruins. This conduct was still more essentially necessary
from the season being advanced, and from the impossibility
of carrying-on any kind of house building during the
winter. Moreover, the utter destruction of that town reduced
to ashes could not hasten its being taken a moment
sooner. You could do no harm to our batteries, which were
much higher than yours; it is not by destroying houses
that towns are taken. You always battered houses, without
reflecting that it is only by ruining the fortifications&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;the
defences&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;and by a breach in the walls, that success
may be hoped for in sieges; and it is certain that you lavished
a prodigious quantity of warlike stores very uselessly.</p>

<p>What advantages could you expect by ruining and distressing
the inhabitants of Quebec, whose houses you burnt?</p>

<p>It was destroying alone for the pleasure of doing injury,
without any advantage accruing to you from it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wolfe</span>:&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;My inaction during the whole summer
should have made you perceive what little hopes I had of
succeeding in my expedition; should it turn out fruitless
after the sum it had cost England, the news of Quebec being
reduced to ashes might blind the extravagant English populace,
and blunt their fanatical fury.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Montcalm</span>:&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;The day that you landed at the Sault de
Montmorency, where you encamped immediately with a
body of four thousand men, in all appearance you did not
know that the river Montmorency was fordable in the wood
about a mile to the north of your camp, where fifty men in
front might pass the ford with water only up to their knees.
Had you passed it immediately, you might have fallen upon
the left of our army, cut them to pieces, and pursued
them two miles, as far as the ravine of Beauport, before they
could assemble a sufficient number of men to be able to resist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
you. You might have even encamped upon the north
side of that ravine, which, having it before you, would have
been a very advantageous post, and brought you several
miles nearer to Quebec. In this case it is highly probable
that we would have been obliged to abandon to you all the
ground between the St. Charles river and the ravine.</p>

<p>To return to my first project of encamping upon the
heights of Abraham, our left was in the greatest security,
not knowing that there was a ford in that river until some
hours after your landing at the Sault.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wolfe</span>:&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;Is it then surprising that I should be ignorant
of that ford, since you did not know it yourself? besides,
it is only the inhabitants in the neighbourhood of rivers,
swamps and lakes, who can give positive and sure information
about them. And supposing I had found some of your
Canadians at their houses there, they are so inviolably attached
to their religion, king and country, that they would
sooner have led me into a snare than instruct me in anything
that could be prejudicial to their army.</p>

<p>Those whom a general sends to examine the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">locale</i> of a
country must do it very superficially upon their own observations,
without consulting or interrogating the peasants in
the neighbourhood.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Montcalm</span>:&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;Whilst your soldiers were employed in
making their camp, and pitching their tents, M. de Levis
and his aide-de-camp Johnstone, were looking at you from
the opposite side of the Sault. His aide-de-camp having
asked him if he was positively certain that there was no
ford in the Montmorency river, M. de Levis answering that
there was not, and that he had been himself to examine it
to its source, at a lake in the woods, about ten or twelve
miles from the Sault. An inhabitant who overheard this
conversation, told the aide-de-camp: “The General is mistaken;
there is a ford which the inhabitants thereabouts pass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
every day in carrying their corn to a mill;” and he added
that he had crossed it lately, with water not above his knees.</p>

<p>The aide-de-camp related to M. de Levis immediately
his conversation with the Canadian, who would not believe
there was a ford, and, examining him roughly, the Canadian
was seized with awe, and respect for the General; his tongue
faltered in his mouth, and he durst not boldly assert the
truth. The aide-de-camp, in a whisper to the Canadian,
ordered him to find out a person who had crossed the ford
lately, and bring him immediately to M. de Levis’ lodgings.
The Canadian came to him in a moment, with a man who
had crossed it the night before, with a sack of wheat upon
his back, where he had found only eight inches deep of
water.</p>

<p>The aide-de-camp being thus assured of the fact, ordered,
in M. de Levis’ name, a detachment to be sent instantly,
with the necessary tools to intrench itself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wolfe</span>:&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;Had I been so lucky as you, sir, to discover
that ford, there is no doubt I would not have let slip so
favourable an opportunity of distinguishing myself, and
would have fallen like lightning upon that part of your camp.
There can be nothing more dangerous than the neighbourhood
of rivers and swamps, that have not been sounded and
examined with the greatest care and attention. Negligence,
ignorance and headstrong obstinacy are equally fatal in
military affairs; and the misfortune of a Lieutenant-General,
in Scotland, against the Highlanders at the battle of Prestonpans,
made so deep an impression upon me that I am
always on my guard when near such places.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Montcalm</span>:&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;How can you, sir, justify your imprudence
in running headlong into the woods opposite to our intrenchments,
with two thousand men, who naturally ought
to have been cut to pieces, and neither you nor any man of
your detachment escape? Nine hundred Indians had invested
you all round at a pistol shot from you, and had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
already cut off your retreat, without your perceiving it. So
soon as the Indians had surrounded you in the wood, they
sent their officer Langlade to acquaint M. de Levis that they
had got you in their net, but that your detachment, appearing
to be about two thousand men, greatly superior to them
in number, they begged earnestly of M. de Levis to order
M. de Repentigny to pass the ford with eleven hundred
men, which he commanded in these intrenchments, and
join them; that they would be answerable upon their heads
if a single man of your detachment should get back to your
camp; and they did not think themselves strong enough to
strike upon you without this reinforcement of Canadians.
There were a great many officers at M. de Levis’ lodgings
when Langlade came to him on behalf of the Indians, and
this General having consulted them, after giving his own
opinion on the affair: “that it was dangerous to attack an
army in the wood, as they could not know the number of
men there; that it might be all the English army, which
consequently might bring on a general engagement without
being prepared for it; and that if he happened to be
repulsed, he would be blamed for engaging in an affair,
without holding previously an order from his superiors,
M. de Vaudreuil and M. de Montcalm.” The officers respected
too much the General not to be of his way of thinking,
and it must ever be so from flattery. His aide-de-camp
alone maintained a different opinion, out of a real friendship
for M. de Levis. He told them that there was not the
smallest probability it could be all the English army, since
the Indians, who never fail to magnify the number, computed
them at only two thousand men. That even supposing
it to be the whole English army, it would be the
most lucky thing that could happen to us to have a general
engagement in the woods, where a Canadian is worth
three disciplined soldiers, as a soldier in a plain is worth
three Canadians; and that nothing was more essential than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
to select the propitious moment and the way of fighting
for those who composed the two-thirds of the army, which
was the case with the Canadians. On the contrary, the
English army was almost entirely composed of regulars
with very few militia.</p>

<p>That M. de Levis could not do better than in ordering M.
de Repentigny to cross the river immediately with his detachment
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">en échelon</i>, and join the Indians, without losing
moments very precious; that at the same time he should
send instantly to inform me of his adventure, in order to
make all the army advance towards the ford, each regiment
taking the place of the other marched off; so that the Regiment
Royal Roussillon, the nearest to the ford, should go
off directly to take the post that Repentigny would quit in
crossing the river, and observing the same for the rest of
the army; that by this means the engaging a general affair
was much to be wished for, supposing all the English army
to be in the woods opposite the ford; in short, that if there
was a possibility of our being defeated and repulsed in the
woods, which could scarce happen, according to all human
probability, we had our retreat assured in the depth of
these woods, well known to the Canadians, where the English
troops could not pursue them, so that in no shape
could M. de Levis run the least risk.</p>

<p>His aide-de-camp added, that when fortune offers her
favours, “they ought to be snatched with avidity.” These
reasons made no impressions on M. de Levis, and Langlade
was sent back to the Indians with a negative reply.</p>

<p>There was two miles from M. de Levis’ quarters to the
place where the Indians were in ambush. Langlade came
back with new entreaties and earnest solicitations to induce
M. de Levis to make Repentigny cross the ford with his
detachment, but the General could not be prevailed upon
to give a positive order to Repentigny to join the Indians.</p>

<p>He wrote a letter to Repentigny by Langlade, wherein he
told him “having the greatest confidence in his prudence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
and good conduct, he might pass the river with his detachment,
if he saw a certainty of success.” His aide-de-camp
told him, whilst he was sealing the letter, that
Repentigny had too much judgment and good sense to take
upon himself an affair of that importance; and his opinion
of Repentigny was immediately justified by his answer;
he asked M. de Levis to give him a clear and positive
order. After thus loitering about an hour and a half, M.
de Levis resolved at last to go himself to the ford, and give
there his orders verbally; but he had scarce got half way
to it when he heard a brisk fire. The Indians, losing all
patience, after having remained so long hid at a pistol shot
from you, like setter dogs upon wild fowl, at last gave you
a volley, killed about a hundred and fifty of your soldiers,
and then retired without losing a man. It is evident that
had Repentigny passed the river with his detachment of
eleven hundred Canadians, you must have been cut to
pieces, and that affair would have terminated your expedition.
Your army could have no more hopes of succeeding
after such a loss; their spirits would have been damped,
and Canada would have been secure from any further invasion
from Great Britain.</p>

<p>Fortune was always as favourable to you, as she constantly
frowned upon us. M. de Levis is not to be blamed; an
officer who serves under the orders of others can only be
reproached when he does not execute punctually the orders
he receives from his superiors; and he has always reason
to be cautious and diffident in such cases where his honour
and reputation may be engaged, as none can be positively
certain of the issue of any military enterprise, and if success
does not crown the venture, of which you have voluntarily
burthened yourself, though undertaken from the best of
motives and apparently for the good of the service, thousands
of mouths will open to spit venom against you.</p>

<p>But of all others, the ignorant amongst the military, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
the knaves, to screen themselves, will surely be violent:
this is so much the more astonishing, in the profession of
arms, where sentiments of honour and honesty ought to be
the foundation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wolfe</span>:&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;My intention in approaching so near your post
at the ford was to examine it carefully, as I then had formed
the design to attack it, little imagining that such a considerable
detachment as I had with me would have been
exposed to be set on by your Indians. Accustomed to
European warfare, I could never have thought that a body
of men should have been so long, so close to me without
discovering them. Your intrenchments there appeared to
be very trifling, but the sight of earth thrown up is respectable,
and not to be despised.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Montcalm</span>:&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;Your attack of the 31st of July, at the only
place of our camp which was inaccessible, appeared to me
unaccountable. From Quebec to Beauport, which was
about four miles, it is a marshy ground, very little higher
than the surface of the St. Lawrence at full tide. The
heights begin at the ravine at Beauport, and rise gradually
all along the border of the river, until at Johnstone’s redoubt
and battery&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;where you made your descent and
attack&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;they become a steep high hill, which ends in a
deep precipice at the Sault de Montmorency. Opposite to
Johnstone’s redoubt it is so steep that your soldiers could
scarce be able to climb it, even without the encumbrance
of their arms.</p>

<p>Besides this natural fortification, we had a continued
intrenchment all along the edge of the hill, from Beauport
to the Sault, so traced and conducted by M. Johnstone that
it was everywhere flanked, and the sloping of it served as
a glacis; thus the fire from the front and flanks would
have destroyed the three-fourths of your army before they
could reach the top of the hill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
But supposing that some of your troops had reached the
top of the hill, up to our trenches, after surmounting these
difficulties, my grenadiers were drawn up in battle behind
them, ready to charge upon them, with their bayonets upon
their muskets, the instant any of your soldiers should
appear at the trenches.</p>

<p>The swampy, sinking ground, from the redoubt to the foot
of the hill, was not one of the smallest difficulties you had
in your way to come at us.</p>

<p>It is true the Scotch Highlanders, who were your forlorn
hope, had got over it and had reached the foot of the hill,
though certainly very few returned; but these turfy swamps,
when a certain number of men have passed them, become
at last impassible, and your soldiers must have sunk down
in it above the head, multitudes of them perishing there in
the most useless and disagreeable manner. Thus, sir, I hope
you see clearly the folly and rashness of that attack, and
that your army must have been totally destroyed, without
hope, had not heaven wrought a miracle in your favor, after
a long cessation of them, which alone could save you.</p>

<p>You were no sooner hotly engaged in the attack, without
a possibility of withdrawing yourself out of the scrape, when
from a clear sunshine there fell in that most critical juncture,
of a sudden, the most violent even, down pour of rain
from a cloud, which, as the cloud that saved Eneas from
the fury of Diomed, placed you immediately out of our
sight, so that in an instant we could not see half way down
the hill. You profited, as a wise man, of this event to make
good your retreat. When the shower was over and we
could see you, we found, to our sorrow, that you had escaped
us, and that you were then out of the reach of our fire,
marching, in a well-formed column, back to your camp at
the Sault, well satisfied to have got out of that adventure
with the loss only of between five and six hundred men.</p>

<p>It was a long time before I could be persuaded that you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
were in earnest. I had always expected your descent and
attack would have been betwixt the St. Charles river and
the ravine of Beauport. All that tract of ground, about four
miles extent, was everywhere favourable to you, if you had
made your real descent in the middle of it, opposite to M.
Vaudreuil’s lodging, with feint attacks at Johnstone’s redoubt,
and at the Canardière near the river St. Charles,
forcing our intrenchments there, which could not resist an
instant a well-formed column. The head of it, composed of
the Scotch Highlanders, might have easily penetrated into
the plain, separating our army into two parts by the centre,
having lodged yourself in the south side of the ravine of
Beauport, and have taken the hornwork upon the St.
Charles river, sword in hand, without much difficulty or loss
of men. In short, all this might have been effected in an
hour’s time, without meeting with any considerable resistance
from our army, thus divided and opened by the
centre; and a complete victory, which would have crushed
us to pieces without hope, would have crowned you with
justly merited laurels.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wolfe</span>:&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;I own to you, sir, I was greatly deceived with
regard to the height and steepness of the hill, which did
not appear considerable, even with a telescope, from the
river St. Lawrence; it was only when I got to the redoubt
that I saw it such as it really is. I began at seven in the
morning to fire at your camp from my battery at the Sault
(of forty cannons) mostly four-and-twenty pounders. The
<i>Centurion</i>, a man-of-war of sixty guns, did the same, as also
the <i>Two Cats</i>, which had on board all the tools necessary
for the workmen. They gave you continually their broadsides,
firing upon your camp, as I did from my battery, like
platoons of infantry.</p>

<p>I dare say you never saw artillery better served and kept
up until six in the evening when I began my landing at
low water. I imagined that this terrible cannonade all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
that day, without a moment’s intermission, would have intimidated
your Canadians and make them quit the trenches;
my battery at the Sault being thirty or forty feet higher
than your camp, we saw them down at the shore. Certainly
you must have lost a great number of men.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Montcalm</span>:&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;That brave militia deserves justly the
greatest praise. Not a man of them stirred from his post,
and they showed as much ardour, courage and resolution as
my regular troops. I had no more than fifty men killed
and wounded by your furious cannonade, which proves
how little cannons are hurtful in comparison to the dread
and respect they inspire. Permit me, sir, to tell you that
your countrymen, the English, appear to me, from their conduct
in Canada, to be as rash, inconsiderate and hot-headed
as the French, who have ever enjoyed that character, notwithstanding
your countrymen’s reputation for coolness and
phlegmatic bravery, since I have seen several examples of
their attacking us before they had examined the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">locale</i>, or
known our position; and if the two nations are compared
impartially, I am persuaded that you will do us the justice
to own that in our operations in Canada we have shown
much more circumspection and coolness than your English
generals. Your attack of the 31st July, without having
procured beforehand an exact knowledge of the hill and of
the places adjacent, is not the first example of great temerity
and impatience on their part.</p>

<p>The proximity of your camp to this hill might have furnished
you the means to have a thorough knowledge of our
position, by sending proper persons to cross over the ford of
the river Montmorency where it falls into the river St. Lawrence,
and where it is fordable at low water.</p>

<p>They might, in a dark night and bad weather, have not
only examined the steepness of the height, but have even
gone over all our camp without being discovered; I always
imagined you did so until the day of your attack, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
soon convinced me of the contrary. Your brother in arms,
Abercrombie, your predecessor in the command of the army,
committed the same fault at Ticonderoga as you did the
31st of July; but it cost him much dearer, the clouds which
saved you not having come to his assistance.</p>

<p>I set out from Montreal on the 5th of May, 1758, to go to
Ticonderoga, with all my regular troops&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;the regiments of
La Sarre, La Reine, Royal Rousillon, Berne, Guienne,
Languedoc, Berry of two battalions, and the independent
companies of the marine detached in Canada; the regiments
from France not being recruited, the whole amounted to
only about four thousand men.</p>

<p>I had no positive information that the English army had
formed the design to come by the lake St. Sacrament in order
to attack Ticonderoga (Carillon), and from thence to go to
Montreal&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;but I suspected it, from the proximity of this ford
to your settlement upon lake St. Sacrament; nor did I cease
beseeching continually M. Vaudreuil, who was then at Quebec,
to send me with all possible diligence the Canadian
militia, which was the principal force for the defence of the
colony.</p>

<p>M. Vaudreuil, who has neither common sense, nor judgment,
could not find out that my military conjectures were
grounded; and instead of sending me the Canadians, he gave
them permission to remain at Montreal, sixty leagues from
Ticonderoga, to attend to their agricultural pursuits.</p>

<p>I dare not allege that he was informed, by the Indians of
the Iroquois nation, that the object of the English was to
invade Canada; that their army was on their way to lake
St. Sacrament; that it was with the view of sacrificing me,
and making me the victim of a cabal, who led him and
governed him blindly, that he kept from me the Canadians.</p>

<p>The 7th of July my conjectures were verified by the arrival
of the English army at the Chûte, where lake St. Sacrament
terminates, about four miles from Ticonderoga, consisting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
of six thousand three hundred men, commanded by
General Abercrombie, who had succeeded to General Braddock,
killed the year before at the river Ohio.</p>

<p>The return of a detachment which I had placed at the
Chûte, as an advanced post, who had lost an hundred and
fifty men, killed by the English on their arrival there, was
a sad confirmation of the bad news. It is scarce possible to
imagine a more dangerous and critical situation than mine&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;without
the aid of Canadians, whose way of fighting was
so essential to me in the woods&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;more useful in those countries
than regular troops. Fort Carillon, or Ticonderoga,
was a square, regularly fortified, each face of it about seventy
fathoms in length.</p>

<p>It had four bastions&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;the walls of masonry, doubled with
a rampart, as likewise a ditch, covered way, and glacis. M.
de Bourlamarque, an officer of great merit and intelligence,
had added a half moon to it.</p>

<p>To retire with my four thousand troops would have been
abandoning the colony to General Abercrombie, as the fort
could not hold out long against so considerable an army;
and being on that side the key of Canada, with the possession
of it in the hands of the English, they might go directly
to Montreal, and be there in fifteen days, without finding
on their way the least obstruction; on the other hand,
the match was very unequal in opposing four thousand
men to thirteen thousand. There was, however, no room
for hesitating, in the choice, and I was soon resolved to
save the colony by a bold and desperate stroke or die, gloriously,
sword in hand. I made everybody work hard all
the night between the 7th and 8th July, cutting down
trees to make an intrenchment (CCCC), which, when finished,
was very weak, trifling, and could scarce serve as a
breast-work to cover the troops.</p>

<p>The engineers, having cut off the branches, laid the trees
upon a line on the heights, three or four of them placed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
horizontally one upon the other, which scarce made it
above three feet high&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;so low that your soldiers might
easily have jumped over it;&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;they made a line of the
branches, at two paces distance, on the outside of the
trenches (HH). It is certain that if the engineers had only
thrown the trees with their heads outwards, and their
branches sharpened in pricking points at their ends, it
would have made a much stronger intrenchment, more
difficult to be forced, and built much <span class="locked">sooner.<a name="FNanchor_C" id="FNanchor_C" href="#Footnote_C" class="fnanchor">C</a></span> I had not
the time to continue the trenches down to the hollow (DD),
at the foot of the height, and I placed there two companies
of grenadiers.</p>

<p>The hollow upon the right of the height, where the intrenchment
was the worst of all my lines, was the post of
the companies of marines (C); the regiments lined the rest
of the trenches. Next day, the 8th of July, the English
army appeared on the borders of the woods, about three
hundred fathoms from the front of our intrenchment on the
height, and instantly advanced to the attack, formed in
three columns (EE), without halting a moment to examine
the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">locale</i>. Two of the columns attacked the height with
the utmost impetuosity, but being very soon entangled
among the branches, on the outside of the trenches, and
impeded by them, they lost there a great many men; some
few got through and, jumping into our trenches, were killed
by our soldiers with their bayonets.</p>

<p>The American riflemen were posted on two heights (GG),
which commanded our trenches, from whence they saw
sideways in some parts of them, and in others the rear of
the soldiers (K).</p>

<p>The regiment of Berry was, above all others, worried and
tormented by their fire&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;one of these heights being scarce
above eighty paces from the intrenchments. The third<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
column attacked the hollow upon our right; but receiving
a brisk fire at its front from the colony troops, and at the
same time upon its right flank from the regiments on the
height, the column soon wavered, wheeled to the right,
and, presenting its front to the height, got out of the reach
of the fire from the right of the colony troops; upon which
M. Raymond, who commanded them, went out of the
trenches with the right wing of these troops, and attacked
the left flank of the column, whilst its head and right flank
were fired at from the height and from the left of the colony
troops in the trenches.</p>

<p>The column, distressed by this firing, yet, nevertheless,
keeping firm at the foot of the height, put in disorder the
regiment of Berry, who abandoned that part of the intrenchment
(II) above it.</p>

<p>The moment I perceived the disorder, I ran there, encouraged
the soldiers of the regiment, made them return to
their post, and supported them by the grenadiers, whom I
had kept in order of battle, at a small distance from the
trenches, as a reserve, to be employed wherever the line
might be forced by your troops, to charge upon them headlong,
their bayonets upon their muskets, without firing:
having neglected nothing that the short time allowed me
to do, in order to make a vigorous defence&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;without aught
to reproach myself with&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;had I been overpowered by your
army; and having always preserved coolness and presence
of mind so as to be able to remedy immediately any disorders
during this long and well disputed attack.</p>

<p>General Abercrombie was at last obliged to retire, after
having continued for some hours, with the greatest obstinacy,
his attempt to force our intrenchments,&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;with the loss
of two thousand <span class="locked">men.<a name="FNanchor_D" id="FNanchor_D" href="#Footnote_D" class="fnanchor">D</a></span></p>

<p>I acquitted myself of my duty: this always affords a
sweet satisfaction in all the events of life; and, even to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
vanquished and unfortunate, it must yield great comfort
and consolation. I had only twelve hours to prepare to
defend myself with five thousand men against thirteen
thousand.</p>

<p>How can General Abercrombie’s rash and blind conduct
be accounted for, for attacking us without examining or
knowing our position? It is astonishing.</p>

<p>During twelve hours that he remained at the Chûte after
landing there, he had time to send and examine the ground
round the fort Ticonderoga; and they might have had a
perfect knowledge of our position from a hill, covered
with big trees, on the opposite side of the river of the
Chûte (P);<a name="FNanchor_E" id="FNanchor_E" href="#Footnote_E" class="fnanchor">E</a> this hill was much higher than any part of
our intrenchments, and not a musket shot from them; he
might have gone there himself with safety, having that
river between us.</p>

<p>Had he halted only a short time after his arrival on the
borders of the wood, about six hundred paces from our
trenches, he might, even from thence, have examined the
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">locale</i> at his leisure. But, seized with impatience, he hurried
to the attack without stopping there a moment&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;and
it is not when an action is engaged that one can then examine
the enemy’s position; or, if he had advanced upon
us the moment of his landing at the Chûte, the 7th instant,
instead of loitering there twelve hours, he would not have
found even those shabby intrenchments; and having so
few (regular) troops, irrespective of the Canadians, I would
have been obliged, on his appearing, to abandon to him all
that part of the country, and retire to Montreal, leaving
only a garrison at Fort Carillon. It was certainly through
his ignorance of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">locale</i> that I repulsed him, instead of
being myself cut to pieces; nor had I any means of retreat,
and my troops must have been all killed or taken prisoners,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
if his third column had marched along the borders of the
wood upon their left; this would have put them out of the
reach of the fire from the height, they could fall upon the
right flank of the trenches of the colony troops, who could
not have resisted a moment the impulse of the column;
instead of wheeling and changing its plan of attack by
presenting its head to the height, had he always advanced
forward to attack the centre of the intrenchments of the
marine, he would have easily pierced through it; then,
wheeling to the right, go up the height, which is there of
an easy ascent, and fire upon the rear of the troops, who
opposed your other two columns, they must have been put
to flight, the trenches abandoned, and, even upon the sight
of your third column coming up the height, I must, of necessity,
have instantly retreated to the fort the best way I
could; there to embark my army in my boats and carry it
down Lake Champlain, without being able to make a resistance
at Fort Frederic, as it is commanded by hills behind
it, about the distance of two hundred paces from its
walls, which makes it a very advantageous post. What
would have been still worse for me, if my trenches had
been forced, there is a space of five leagues between Fort
Frederic and Ticonderoga, by the river St. Frederic, which,
about half way, is scarce above fifty or sixty fathoms broad,
and is a most advantageous post, where not a boat would
pass by, and must cut off entirely the communication with
Lake Champlain, as it is an equal distance from the Chûte
or from Ticonderoga.</p>

<p>General Abercrombie might have sent a body of troops to
establish there a post, in which case we must have laid down
our arms and surrendered ourselves prisoners to him, for
want of subsistence, and from the impossibility of retreating
by land.</p>

<p>General Abercrombie might have likewise penetrated
easily at the hollow, which I had not the time to intrench,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
where I had placed two companies of volunteers; and this
would have had equally fatal consequences for me, as the
third column might have been on the other side of the height,
the ascent there not being steep or of difficult access.</p>

<p>But his attacks were always obstinately directed at the
most difficult places of the height, as if there had been a
cloud before his eyes to hinder him from seeing to his right
and left what was visible to the most ignorant officer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wolfe</span>:&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;That was a most glorious day for you, sir,&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;worthy
of the ambition of a great man. Our columns were
only at ten steps distance from your intrenchments, and all
our army saw you perfectly well, constantly at work encouraging
and exciting the ardour of your soldiers, hurrying
over your lines perpetually some paces from your trenches;
exposing your person too rashly compared to the custom of
our army, your eye glancing over the whole, with the attitude
of a lion. General Abercrombie perceived, clearly, the
disorder upon your right when the regiment of Berry was
about to retire, and redoubled his efforts to profit by it. But
you were everywhere, travelling from place to place with
the swiftness of the eagle; never at a loss; reforming the
smallest disorder so soon as it was visible, and preventing
it from spreading, as it generally does, like a flash of lightning.
This affair won you so great a reputation in England
for capacity and talent, that I own to you, sir, the idea of
having an antagonist of your knowledge and merit, made
me during the campaign always irresolute, vacillating in
my opinions and undecided in my projects. I cannot condemn
my predecessors who had the command of the English
armies in Canada. The way of fighting of the Canadians
and Indians in the woods is so different from that practised
in Europe, that I readily believe the most able General,
with an army of the best disciplined troops, in following
exactly the rules of the art of war,&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;whose principles are
sure, fixed and demonstrable in European warfare,&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
be easily cut to pieces in those vast forests by a very few
Indians. There was an outcry in England against General
Braddock, for allowing his army of four thousand men to
be cut to pieces at the river <span class="locked">Ohio,<a name="FNanchor_F" id="FNanchor_F" href="#Footnote_F" class="fnanchor">F</a></span> in the year 1755, by six
hundred and fifty Canadians and Indians only, much more
than they blame General Abercrombie.</p>

<p>The reason of it is clear. Abercrombie lived to return
to England: the living always find means to justify themselves.
But Braddock was killed: the dead are always in
the wrong, and never find disinterested advocates to plead
their cause. Braddock’s order of march&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;criticised by your
French Generals&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;may, at first sight, appear singular; and
may pretend that he must of necessity have been beat, in
consequence of the bad disposition of it. But analize it,
and you will find nothing else than the common rule practised
through all Europe in passing through a wood: an
army formed in three columns&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;the artillery, baggage,
waggons and cavalry being the column of the centre, between
the other two columns of infantry; half of the Grenadiers
at their head to support the Pioneers employed in
opening a road through the wood for the passage of the
carts and artillery, and the rest in the rear, to close of
march. Braddock was invested on all sides by the Canadians,
and dispersed in the wood, each of them behind a
tree, marking out his victim; so that every musket-shot
brought down a soldier, and at every discharge they flew from
tree to tree. What can regular troops do in such a case?
Close their ranks and files each moment, as did Braddock,
direct a continual fire at the woods, without perceiving a
man, and be cut to pieces without seeing an enemy. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
is no other method for troops to defend themselves against
the Indians than what I practised, with success, when I
was surprised by them at the ford of the River Montmorency:
the soldiers, with fixed bayonets, dispersed themselves,
rushed on in disorder towards the places where they
perceived the smoke of the Indians’ discharge; and by
these means my detachment in the woods chased away your
nine hundred Indians, who in a moment disappeared entirely,
and suffered me to retire at my leisure to my camp.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Montcalm</span>:&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;I verily believe, sir, that your idea is just.
The Indians told me, on their return, that it was now no
more possible to fight you as formerly, since the English
had learned their (the Indians’) way of fighting. There cannot
be a greater advantage for a General than the entire
knowledge of the country&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;the seat of war: without this,
he must always grope in the dark&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;be foiled in his operations&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;rest
often inactive, uncertain in his projects; and
be only inactive and on the defensive, as you were all the
summer as much as me. You were absolutely master of
the River St. Lawrence by your men-of-war, who had ascended
it, passing by Quebec with incredible boldness, and
scorning the most murderous fire from the batteries of the
town so near them. You had an infinite number of boats
at your disposal, with all the sailors of your fleet for rowers.
What, then, could hinder you from sending a body of
twelve or fifteen hundred men in different detachments,
with engineers and able officers, in order to be continually
landing, to get a thorough knowledge of the country, draw
plans of all the advantageous positions which abound there;
and this detachment, if well led, might have gone even to
Montreal without finding any opposition in their course.
Their descriptions and plans of the country would have enlightened
you, and furnished the means of destroying and
crushing our army without fighting: this is the touchstone
to prove superior talents and capacity in a General. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
gaining of a battle is very often the effect of mere chance.
But reducing an enemy without fighting must be the result
of well-combined operations,&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;is the essence of military
science, and was always the most radient and distinctive
<em>trait</em> in the conduct and character of the great men whom
history has handed down to us. Grounded upon the instructions
received from the engineers and officers of their
detachments, you might have verified their observations by
your prisoners, who say always more than they intend,
when examined with kindness, coolness, and with a seeming
indifference. The only achievement which you performed
during two months that you lay constantly loitering
in your camps, looking at us, was your attack of the
31st of July; and your expedition to Deschambault, where
you sent a body of two thousand men, fourteen leagues up
the river from Quebec, to burn and pillage a poor, miserable
peasant’s house, in which was the baggage of some French
regiments! But the detachment had no intention of examining
the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">locale</i> of the country. Had they gone to Jacques
Cartier, only three leagues from Deschambault, they would
have discovered there a post strong by nature, which certainly
cannot be inferior to the Thermopylæ so celebrated
by the Greeks, and capable of being defended&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;you being
the masters of the River St. Lawrence&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;by as few men as
Leonidas had with him against the most numerous army.
But your detachment at Deschambault, upon the appearance
of my cavalry, composed merely of two hundred undisciplined
Canadians on horseback, commanded by the
Chevalier de LaRochebeaucourt, ran to their boats and embarked
with great disorder and confusion, as if our army
had been at their heels, without having remained there
above two hours. Jacques Cartier&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;which takes its name
from he who first discovered the River St. Lawrence, and
who, having lost his ship, passed there the winter amongst
the Indians&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;in an immense ravine, with a rapid, shaggy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
river full of large rocks, that runs between the two heights,
whose tops are about two hundred fathoms distant from
each other; their sides are as glacis, with a view from their
tops to the bottom&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;four or five hundred feet deep&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;which
strikes the eyes with horror on looking down that vast
precipice. Its side, facing the River St. Lawrence, is a
steep perpendicular rock; and the ground to the north is
impracticable from the lakes, swamps, and sinking turf,
where at each step a person must plunge over the head and
perish. It must be impossible to turn round it and leave
it behind, since the Canadians and the Indians never discovered
a passage through the woods. Thus the only
means of approaching this fort must have been by landing
at Deschambault. From thence to Jacques Cartier, it is an
easy and gradually rising ascent. Had you seized this extraordinary
fort, you would have cut off my communication
with Montreal, from whence I drew daily my supplies for
the army: in this event, I had no other alternative than
allowing my army to perish of famine, or surrender the
colony. But as we had been sent from Europe, not to
destroy the inhabitants, but, on the contrary, to save and
defend them, I must have immediately concluded by capitulating
for Canada upon the best terms I could obtain
from you. I hope I have demonstrated clearly to you that,
had you been acquainted with the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">locale</i>, you could have
made the glorious conquest of Canada without shedding a
drop of blood.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wolfe</span>:&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;You argue, sir, at your ease! How was it
possible to examine and know the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">locale</i> of that country,
your bloodhounds&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;the Indians and Canadians&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;being
constantly at our heels: one cannot send out scouts in Canada,
as is done in Europe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Montcalm</span>:&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;Why not? Men cannot be in two places
at the same time; and you managed to find everywhere
Indians and Canadians in your way! There are many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
kinds of irregular troops in Europe as bad to deal with as
the Indians in woods and in wooded countries. But your
army was always so struck with terror and dread, that,
constantly blinded with fear, the shadow of an Indian set
them a trembling. Nevertheless, the New England independent
companies, formed by Roger, who afterwards beat
the Indians with equal numbers in their own way of fighting
behind trees, should have removed the formidable impression
they have always made upon the English. Self-preservation
is natural to all mankind, and the hour of death
must strike with horror the bravest man. But fear is pardonable
amongst soldiers only when there exists a real
cause for fear; and is not to be tolerated when groundless:
this is so much the case of your soldiers with regard to the
Indians, that, demoralized by fear, they suffer themselves to
be butchered by a vastly inferior number of Indians, without
ever thinking of defending themselves, even when
they know they will have no quarter. In any danger,
soldiers ought to be accustomed to look coolly death in
the face,&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;they, whose duty is to die when the Sovereign
demands it: such is the contract they sign with the latter
on their entering into his service.</p>

<p>These sentiments may be often the means of one’s preserving
life instead of losing it. Nothing is more incomprehensible
to me, in all your conduct in Canada, than
your landing at <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Anse des Mères</i> on the 13th September (the
fatal day which deprived us both of our existence, but
freed us from mortal folly), at the foot of a steep hill, where
a few men at the top of it, with sticks and stones only,
must have easily beaten you back on your attempt to climb
it, and where we had three posts of one hundred men
each: one of them commanded by Douglas, captain in the
regiment of Languedoc; another by Rimini, captain in the
regiment La Sarre; and the third by De Vergor, captain in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
the Colony troops, at whose <span class="locked">post<a name="FNanchor_G" id="FNanchor_G" href="#Footnote_G" class="fnanchor">G</a></span> you made your descent.
These three hundred men, had they done their duty,
should have been more than sufficient to have repulsed
you ignominiously at this steep hill; and you never would
have got to the top had you met with the smallest resistance.
I own that your daring surpasses my conception.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wolfe</span>:&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;I do not pretend to justify my project by its
success, but by my combinations, which answered exactly
as I had foreseen, and which demonstrate my scheme to
have been well concerted. In giving you this account of
it, I am persuaded that you will not blame me for undertaking
an attempt so absurd in appearance, and yet most
reasonable when examined impartially. In all expeditions
composed of sea and land forces, it seldom fails that disputes,
animosities, jealousies and quarrels arise between
the different commanders equal in authority; and it is a
miracle if you see the Admiral and the General unanimously
of the same opinion with regard to operations. The sea
and the land service are sciences whose principles are entirely
different; as certainly there can be no analogy between
the working of a ship and the drill of a regiment.
Nevertheless, the Admiral meddles continually with the
land operations, and the General will have the fleets do
things that are impossible&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;both of them equally ignorant
of each other’s service; from whence results a clashing discord
in their operations, when sent out with equal power.
If each of them would confine himself to that part of the
art of war which he has studied, and have only in his soul
the good and welfare of his King and Country, these mixed
expeditions of land and sea would succeed much better
than they generally do. The naval officers tormented me
a great deal, and were still more troublesome as the season
advanced. They held a council of war on board the flagship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
on the 10th September, when it was determined to set
sail immediately for Europe, seeing the imminent dangers
to which His Majesty’s fleet would be exposed in those
tempestuous seas by remaining any longer before Quebec;
and, in consequence of this decision, orders were given to
some men-of-war to take up their anchors and fall down
the river, while orders were issued at the same time to begin
the general preparations for the immediate departure
of all the fleet. The 12th, there came two deserters to me
from one of your three posts you just now mentioned, who
belonged to the French regiments, and were well informed.
Upon examining them, I discovered that your posts were
guarded very negligently; that de Bougainville, who was
at Cap Rouge, proposed to send down, the night following,
some boats loaded with provisions, and that your three
posts had their orders to let these boats pass unmolested.
The idea instantly occurred to me to profit by this discovery;
and I ran to the Admiral, communicated to him what I had
learned from the French deserters, begged him most
earnestly to suffer me to make a last attempt before the
embarkation of my army. I promised him that if there
were twenty muskets fired from your posts, I would then
desist immediately without further thought than to embark
speedily in order to return to England. The council
consented to my demand, and I began my landing at
eleven at night. When my boats approached the two
posts of Douglas and Rimini, upon their sentinels calling
“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Qui vive!</i>” my soldiers answered them in French,
“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Bateaux des vivres</i>,” upon which they suffered them to
go on without stopping them, as they might have done, in
order to receive the password. Not finding a sentry at
your third post, commanded by De Vergor, I landed there
with diligence, and all my army was ashore before this
post perceived our men, without firing but one musket,
which wounded De Vergor in the heel, who was immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
taken prisoner without finding any man of his
detachment with <span class="locked">him.<a name="FNanchor_H" id="FNanchor_H" href="#Footnote_H" class="fnanchor">H</a></span> I began my operation by landing
there a Sergeant with ten Grenadiers, ordering him to
advance always straight before him briskly, with long
steps, and not to halt unless he was discovered by the
enemy. A Lieutenant, with a detachment of Grenadiers,
followed him, having the same orders, to halt instantly if
they fired at him. The silence continuing, I then landed
all my Grenadiers, who followed the Sergeant and the
Lieutenant; and by degrees all my army landed without
the least noise, disorder or confusion. The silence soon
convinced me that they were not discovered; dissipated
my fears, and assured me of the success of my enterprise.
The head of the column, which was the guide to the rest
of the army, got up the hill with difficulty, the others
following them at their heels. If your guards had been
vigilant and done their duty, all I risked was the Sergeant
and Lieutenant, with a few Grenadiers. I would have
stopped at the first discharge, as it would have been
madness and unpardonable to attack by main force a hill
so inaccessible that, even without an enemy at the top to
repel them, my men had much difficulty to climb it.
Moreover, I was assured by your deserters you had no
troops on the heights of Abraham. You see now, sir, that
it was not a heedless, ill-concerted project,&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;but a sure
operation, without risking much. An invariable principle
with me has ever been to make an attack where it appears
the most difficult; and it generally meets with success, as
the point is commonly ill-guarded, frequently entirely
neglected, and scarcely comprehended in the plan of
defence. I am not alone of this opinion. Cardinal Ximenes
says, that “Ferdinand, King of Arragon, fitted out two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
armies against the Moors, under the conduct of Count
D’Aguilar, and ordered them to enter into the mountains
of Grenada at the same time, by the places the most
difficult,” and consequently the least guarded. He gained
a most complete victory over the Moors. The most difficult
gorges of mountains, when not guarded where only a
single man can pass, a hundred thousand may do the
same. It is then an easy operation, by forming your men
in battle as soon as they get through the passage, and
provided that they are not immediately discovered by the
enemy. When once you have a front capable to oppose
and stand firm, it increases every instant, as you may be
convinced that the soldiers go through the dangerous
passage with great quickness. Besides, the enemy is always
disconcerted by a surprise; demoralized by an unforeseen
incident, he becomes timid and alarmed, and may be
looked upon as already vanquished before the action
begins. The landing at Cap Breton was executed according
to my system. The enemy does not expect you at
a place of difficult access; it is where he does not
expect me that I would make my principal attack. Commonly,
men suffer most where they are most <span class="locked">seen.<a name="FNanchor_I" id="FNanchor_I" href="#Footnote_I" class="fnanchor">I</a></span> But
if they are entirely neglected&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;as it happened at Louisbourg&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;it
is a fault of the General, who should be answerable
for it. But the General having placed upon them a
sufficient number of troops in proportion to their difficulties,
can he be blamed if the officers of these posts do not do
their duty?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Montcalm</span>:&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;Can there be any divine or human law to
punish a man for the faults of others? Should they not
answer personally? It has often happened that the safety
of a whole army has depended upon a subaltern’s guard!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
You see that the deserters caused you to make a last
attempt&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;prevented your embarking your army for England&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;your
giving up your enterprise&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;and, in short, ended in
adding Canada to the British dominions; and perhaps a
vigilant officer at that post (Wolfe’s Cove) might have
hindered the soldiers from deserting, which would at once
have removed a first cause which produced so many
extraordinary effects. Your system may be good, if executed
with great prudence and precaution. But should the
enemy be informed of your design, which he may be by a
deserter acquainted with your great preparations, as you
were with the negligence of our posts, it is an excellent
opportunity to have your army cut to pieces and catch a
tartar; as it must have been your case at the Sault de
Montmorency (on the 31st July), had it not been for that
sudden shower of rain, which came to your rescue in the
critical moment, when your destruction was otherwise
inevitable. At least, sir, confess the injustice of mankind.
They reproach me with being the cause of your success!
They accuse me of having sacrificed the welfare of my
army through jealousy and ill-feeling! My king and
country&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;for whom I would have shed, with pleasure,
every drop of my blood&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;and those who view my case
the most favourably, look on me as a giddy, ignorant
officer! All these scandalous, atrocious lies and calumnies
were spread everywhere by a <span class="locked">set<a name="FNanchor_J" id="FNanchor_J" href="#Footnote_J" class="fnanchor">J</a></span> of men who, from their
immoderate thirst of riches, would, to serve their interest,
have betrayed their king and country. Those vile, mercenary
souls knew that I detested them as much as I constantly
cherished honest men, whose noble sentiments endeared
them to me. My death was happy for them. Had I lived
to return to Europe, I would have had no difficulty to
justify all my conduct, and crush these wretches like
vermin. Covetousness and avarice carried them to Canada;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
they left their honour and honesty in France on embarking,
easily forgetting what it is to be just and patriotic. I would
have soon confounded them. Truth supports oppressed
innocence, and, sooner or later, dispels the clouds which
too often overshadow it. I shall give you a faithful and
exact account of my conduct with regard to the operations
of the 13th September, following scrupulously truth, which
has always been the rule of my actions and is held in great
veneration by me; and I hope to demonstrate to you that
if the end of that campaign covered you with glory, Fortune
was the chief agent, who reunited in your power a great
number of circumstances, the absence of any one of which
sufficed to render your expedition fruitless.</p>

<p>Some days after the action of the 31st of July, M. de
Levis was sent by M. Vaudreuil to command at Montreal,
upon a false report that a body of English was coming to
attack Canada by Lake Champlain&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;a story trumped up by
my enemies to deprive me of M. de Levis, in whom I had
the greatest confidence, on account of his talents: I cannot
say he made me a just acknowledgment of my sentiments
towards him. I went to his lodgings a few hours before
his departure, which was kept a secret from the army;
and as I was little acquainted with his plan of defence for
the left of our camp, at the Sault de Montmorency, I begged
of him, as a favour, to leave me his aide-de-camp, M.
Johnstone, who had a perfect knowledge of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">locale</i> of
that part of the country. Your boats having caused us an
alarm in the night between the 10th and 11th of September,
by their appearance opposite to the ravine of Beauport, I
remained at M. Vaudreuil’s until one in the morning,
when I left him in order that I might return to my lodging&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;having
with me M. Montreuil, Major-General of the
army, and M. Johnstone. On my sending away M. de
Vaudreuil, after giving him my orders, I related immediately
to M. Johnstone all the measures I had concerted with M.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
de Vaudreuil, in case you (Gen. Wolfe) made a descent at
daybreak. He answered me, that your army being now
assembled at Point Levi, and part of it gone above Quebec,
on the south side of the River St. Lawrence, it appeared
very doubtful where you might attempt a descent&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;whether
above the town, or below it towards the <i>Canardière</i>;
he added, that he believed a body of troops might be
advantageously placed upon the heights of Abraham, where
they could with certainty confront you whenever you
landed. I approved greatly of his idea. I called back
Montreuil&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;who was as yet not far from us&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;and I ordered
him to send the Regiment of Guienne&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;which was encamped
near the hornwork at the River St. Charles&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;to pass the
night upon the heights of Abraham. Next morning&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;the
11th&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;I wrote to Montreuil, ordering him to make this
regiment encamp upon the heights of Abraham, and
remain there until further orders. Thus, in consequence
of my repeated orders, I had all the reason possible to
believe that this regiment constitued a permanent post
there; so that the declaration of the deserters from the
three posts, who could not know this, might have led you
into a dangerous snare, worse than that of the 31st July.
Why this regiment continued the 12th in this camp at the
hornwork, in spite of my express orders to encamp upon
the heights, I know not; and can only attribute Montreuil’s
disobedience of my orders to the weakness of his judgment
and understanding. It is nevertheless evident that, if you
had found the Regiment of Guienne upon the top of the
hill&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;where it ought to have been, had my orders been
obeyed&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;you would have been repulsed shamefully with a
much greater loss than you met with on the 31st July at
the Sault; the height where you made your descent, the
13th of September, being infinitely steeper than that there
which obliged you to make a speedy retreat, favoured by
the <em>providential shower</em>. Or, perhaps you would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
embarked immediately your army, without any further
attempt, to return to England, after a most ruinous and
fruitless expedition&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;the campaign ending with an incredible
expense to your nation&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;fruitless; and, by this means, the
colony of Canada would have been for ever delivered from
such formidable armies.</p>

<p>As soon as your army was reunited in a single camp at
Pointe Levi, after having been so long separated, upon you
sending a body of troops up the River St. Lawrence, I
detached M. de Bougainville, with fifteen hundred of my
best troops&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;composed of all my Grenadiers, of the
Volunteers from the French Regiments, of my best Canadians
and Indians; and I likewise gave him some small
guns. I ordered him strictly to follow all your movements,
by ascending the river when you went up, and descending
as you did the same: in short, to be an army of observation,
with only the river between you&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;never to lose sight of
you&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;ever ready to oppose your passage up the river, and
to fall on you with the swiftness of the eagle the moment
you attempted to land on our side of it. He sent to inform
me, the 13th of September, that all your army had descended
to your camp at Pointe Levi. But he remained loitering
with his detachment at Cap Rouge&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;three leagues from
Quebec! Why did he not follow you to the heights of
Abraham, according to his orders? Why did he not send
me back my Grenadiers and Volunteers&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;the very flower
of their Regiments? informing me, as also the posts of
Douglas and Rimini, that he would send down that night.
I cannot conceive the reasons for such conduct: it is beyond
all conception! He was informed, between seven and
eight in the morning, by the fugitives from the three posts,
that your army was landed and drawn up in battle upon
the heights of Abraham; upon which he left Cap Rouge
with his detachment, no doubt with the intention to join
me. But, instead of taking the road to Lorette, or to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
General Hospital along the borders of the River St. Charles,
which led both of them to our camp, he followed the heights
of Abraham, where he was evidently certain by his information
to find there your army to intercept him; and it
could never be his design to fight you with fifteen hundred
men! He found a house on his way, with three or four
hundred of your troops barricading it, and was very desirous
to take them prisoners. M. le Noir, Captain in the Regiment
La Sarre&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;having more bravery than prudence and
knowledge of the art of war&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;attacked the house with the
most astonishing boldness, and had more than half of his
company of Volunteers killed: he received himself two
wounds&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;one of them by a ball through the body, and the
other in his hand. De Bougainville, intent on taking the
house, waited there the arrival of the cannon, to force it;
but when the cannon arrived, it unluckily happened that
the balls had been forgotten at Cap Rouge, which obliged
him to return there, abandoning the house without a
moment’s reflection. How much more important it would
have been to direct his march towards the General Hospital,
in order to join my army! Thus were precious moments
wasted ridiculously in the most trifling manner. De
Bougainville&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;who has a great deal of wit, good sense,
many good qualities&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;was protected by a very great person
at Court; he is personally brave, has but little knowledge
in the military science, having never studied it.</p>

<p>The night between the 12th and 13th of September, when
you made your descent, M. Poularies, Commander of the
Regiment Royal Roussillon, who encamped behind my lodgings
at Beauport, came to me, at midnight, to inform me that
they saw boats opposite to his regiment. Upon which I immediately
ordered all the army to line the trenches; and I
sent Marcel&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;who served me as Secretary and aid-de-camp&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;to
pass the night at M. de Vaudreuil’s, giving him one of
my Cavaliers of Ordnance, ordering Marcel, if there was anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
extraordinary in that quarter, to inform me of it speedily
by the Cavalier. I was out and walked with Poularies
and Johnstone, between my house and the ravine of Beauport,
until one in the morning, when I sent Poularies to his
regiment, and I continued there with Johnstone. All night
my mind was in the most violent agitation, which I believe
proceeded from my uneasiness for the boats and provisions
that de Bougainville had acquainted me, would be sent down
the river that night; and I repeated often to Johnstone, that
I trembled lest they should be taken, “that loss would ruin
us without resource, having provisions only for two days’
subsistence to our army.” It appears to me that my extraordinary
sufferings that night were a presage of my cruel
fate some hours afterwards. At daybreak they fired some
cannon from our battery at Samos, near Sillery. I then had
no more doubts of our boats being taken by you. Alas! I
would never have imagined that my provisions were in
safety at Cap Rouge with de Bougainville, and that you were
upon the heights of Abraham since midnight, without my
being informed of an event of so great importance, and which
was known through all the right of our camp.</p>

<p>The day clearing up, having news from Marcel at M. de
Vaudreuil’s, who had always my Cavalier of Ordnance with
him, and perceiving no changes in your camp at Point Levis,
my mind was more composed on reflecting that, if anything
extraordinary had happened, I would certainly have been
informed of it. I then sent Johnstone to order all the army
to their tents, having passed the night in the trenches, and
retired to my lodgings after drinking some dishes of tea with
Johnstone. I desired him to order the servants to saddle
the horses, in order to go to M. de Vaudreuil’s and be informed
of the cause of the firing from our battery at Samos. Not
a soul having come to me from the right of our camp since
midnight when I sent there Marcel, I set out with Johnstone
between six and seven in the morning. Heavens, what was
my surprise! when opposite to M. de Vaudreuil’s lodgings,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
the first news of what had passed during the night was the
sight of your army upon the heights of Abraham, firing at
the Canadians scattered amongst the bushes. I met at the
same time M. de Vaudreuil coming out of his lodgings, and
having spoke to him an instant, I turned away to Johnstone,
and told him: “the affair is serious! run with the greatest
speed to Beauport; order Poularies to remain there at the
Ravine with two hundred men, and to send me all the rest
of the left to the heights of Abraham with the utmost diligence.”</p>

<p>Johnstone having delivered my orders to Poularies, he
quitted him an instant to give some instructions to my servants
at my lodgings; returning to rejoin me, he found
Poularies in the Ravine with M. de Sennezergue, Brigadier-General
and Lieutenant-Colonel of the Regiment of La Sarre,
and de Lotbinière, Captain of the Colony troops and aide-de-camp
to M. de Vaudreuil. Poularies stopped Johnstone to
make him repeat to them my orders, which he did; and at
the same time advised Poularies, as a friend, to disobey them,
by coming himself to the heights of Abraham with every
man of the left, since it was evident that the English army&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;already
landed near Quebec&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;could never think of making
a second descent at Beauport; and that it was manifest
there would be in a few hours an engagement upon the
heights which would immediately decide the fate of the
Colony. Poularies then showed Johnstone a written order&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;signed
“Montreuil”&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;which Lotbinière had brought to him
from M. de Vaudreuil, “That not a man of the left should
stir from the camp!” Johnstone declared to them, upon his
honour, that it was word for word my orders and my intentions;
and he entreated Poularies, in the most pressing
manner, to have no regard for that order signed “Montreuil,”
as the want of two thousand men, which formed the left of
our camp, must be of the greatest consequence in the battle.
M. de Sennezergue&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;an officer of the greatest worth and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
honour, who fell a few hours afterwards&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;told Johnstone:
“That he (Johnstone) should take it upon him to make all
the left march of immediately.” Johnstone answered:
“That, being only the bearer of my orders, he could take
nothing upon him. But if he was in M. de Sennezergue’s
place, Brigadier-General, and, by M. de Levis’ absence, the
next in command of the army, he would not hesitate a moment
to make the left march, without any regard whatsoever
to any order that might be hurtful to the King’s service,
in that critical juncture.” Johnstone left them irresolute
and doubtful how to act, clapped spurs to his horse,
and rejoined me immediately upon the heights.</p>

<p>I don’t know, any more than a thousand others, the particulars
relative to the action of the 13th of September. I
am ignorant of who it was that made our army take their
abominable and senseless position, by thrusting it betwixt
your army and Quebec, where there were no provisions, and
the best of our troops absent with de Bougainville; it certainly
must have been dictated by an ignorant and stupid
blockhead! I certainly had no hand in it: the piquets and
part of the troops were already marched up the heights before
I came to the Canardière, or ever knew that you were
landed; and all the right of our army was marching after
them when I arrived at their encampment. The only proper
course to be taken in our position, and which would
have been apparent to any man of common sense who had
the least knowledge of the art of war, was to quit our camp
coolly&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;calmly&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;without disorder or confusion, and march
to Lorette; from thence cross over to St. Foix&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;which is two
leagues from Quebec and a league from Cap Rouge&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;and
when joined there by M. de Bougainville’s detachment, to
advance then and attack you as soon as possible. By these
means you would have found yourself between two fires, by
a sally from the town the moment that I attacked you on
the other side. I was no sooner upon the heights than I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
perceived our horrible position,&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;pressed against the town-walls,
without provisions for four-and-twenty hours, and a
moral impossibility for us to retire, being drawn up in battle
at the distance of a musket-shot from your army. Had
I made an attempt to go down the heights, in order to repass
the River St. Charles and return to my camp, I would have
exposed my left flank to you, and my rear would have been
cut to pieces without being able to protect and support it.
Had I entered into the town, in an instant you would have
invested us in it, without provisions, by carrying down your
left wing to the River St. Charles&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;an easy movement of a
few minutes. I saw no remedy other for us than to worry
your army by a cannonade, having the advantage over you
of a rising ground suitable for batteries of cannon, hoping,
by thus harassing you, that you might retire in the night,
as certainly you could never be so rash as to think of attacking
us under the guns of the town; at least I would have
made my retreat, taking advantage of the darkness of the
night, to get myself out of the scrape where the ignorance
of others had thrown me. I sent several persons with orders
to M. de Ramsay, King’s Lieutenant (Deputy Governor),
who was in command at Quebec, to send me, with all possible
haste, the five-and-twenty brass field pieces that were
in position on the palace battery, near our army; and precisely
at the same instant when Johnstone came to me on
the heights, with the news of the order which prevented
the left of our army to join me, a sergeant arrived from M.
de Ramsay&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;the fourth person I had sent to him with my
orders&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;with a categorical answer from him: “That he had
already sent me three pieces of artillery; and that he could
not send me any more, having his town to defend!” What
could be de Ramsay’s reasons for such a monstrous conduct,
or who it was who inspired him with such a daring disobedience,
I know not?</p>

<p>1. “His town”&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;as he called it&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;was defended by our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
army which covered it, being drawn up in battle about two
hundred fathoms from it; and its safety depended entirely
upon the event of a battle.</p>

<p>2. There were in Quebec about two hundred pieces of
cannon, most of them twenty-four and thirty-six pounders.</p>

<p>3. Small field-pieces, two or three pounders&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;such as the
palace battery&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;could they be of the least service for the defence
of a town?</p>

<p>4. A commander of Quebec, as King’s Lieutenant or sub-Lieutenant,
such as de Ramsay was&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;not Governor,&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;or
even M. de Vaudreuil himself, Governor General of Canada,
at that moment in the town,&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;could they have any authority
to refuse me all the assistance I could desire from Quebec,
by my particular commission of Commander-in-Chief of the
troops in Canada, when my army was at the gates of the town,
and your army deployed ready to fight? A thousand other
queries suggest themselves; but of what avail?</p>

<p>I assembled immediately a council of war, composed of all
the commanding officers of the several regiments, to hear
their opinion as to what was to be done in our critical situation.
Some of them maintained you were busy throwing
up breastworks. Others, that you appeared bent on descending
in the valley, in order to seize the bridge of boats on the
St. Charles river with the hornwork, with the object of cutting
off our communication with the left wing of our army,
which remained at Beauport pursuant to the order signed by
Montreuil. In effect, a movement your army made in that
moment towards the windmill and Borgia’s house, upon the
edge of the height, seemed to favour this conjecture. But
an instant afterwards, the Canadians having set fire to that
house and chased you from it, you retook your former position.
Others alleged, that the more we delayed attacking
you, the more your army would be strong&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;imagining that
your troops had not yet all landed. In short, there was
not a single member of the war council who was not of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
opinion to charge upon you immediately. Can it be credited
that these officers&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;to the dishonour of mankind&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;who
were the most violent to attack you, denied it afterwards,
and became the most ardent censors of my conduct
in not deferring the battle! What could I do in my desperate
situation? Even a Marshal Turenne would have
been much puzzled to get out of such a dilemma, in which
they had entangled me either through design or ignorance.
I listened with attention to their opinion, without opening
my lips, and at last answered them:&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;“It appears to me,
gentlemen, that you are unanimous for giving battle;
and that the only question now is, how to charge the
enemy?” Montreuil said it would be better to attack in
columns. I answered him: “That we would be beat before
our columns could be formed so near to the enemy;
and, besides, that our columns must be very weak, not
having Grenadiers to place at their heads.” I added, that
“since it is decided to attack, it must be in Front Baudière(?)”
I sent all the officers to their posts, and ordered
the drummers to beat the charge.</p>

<p>Our onset was neither brisk nor long. We went on in
confusion&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;were repulsed in an instant; and it could not
naturally be otherwise from the absence of our Volunteers
and Grenadiers, and de Bougainville at Cap Rouge with
the best of our Canadians; the Montreal regiments with
Poularies at Beauport, a league and a half from the battle-field.
The example of the bravest soldiers in a regiment&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;the
Grenadiers and Volunteers&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;suffices to infuse courage
in the most timid, who can follow the road shown to them,
but cannot lead the way. The brave Canadian Militia saw
us with heavy hearts, grief and despair, from the other side
of the St. Charles river, cut to pieces upon the heights,
stopped, as they were, in the hornwork, and prevented by
superior orders from rushing to our assistance. About two
hundred brave and resolute Canadians rallied in the hollow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
at the bakehouse, and returned upon the heights. They
fell instantly upon your left wing with incredible rage;
stopped your army for some minutes from pursuing our
soldiers in their flight, by attracting your attention to them;
resisted, undaunted, the shock of your left; and, when repulsed,
they disputed the ground inch by inch from the
top to the bottom of the height, pursued by your troops
down to the valley at the bakehouse, opposite to the hornwork.
These unfortunate heroes&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;who were most of them
cut to pieces&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;saved your army the loss of a great many
men, by not being hotly pursued; and if your left, who
followed these two hundred Canadians down to the plain,
had crossed it from the bakehouse to the River St. Charles,
only three or four hundred paces, they would have cut off
the retreat of our army, invested the three-fourths of them
in Quebec, without provisions, and M. de Vaudreuil, next
day, must have surrendered the town and asked to capitulate
for the colony. But your conduct cannot be blamed,
as it is always wise and prudent in giving&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;as Pyrrhus
advises&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;a golden bridge to one’s enemy in flight.</p>

<p>You see, sir, by this true and faithful account of the
battle of the 13th September, and of what preceded it, how
many different and unforeseen events, fortune was obliged
to unite in your favour to render you successful in your
expedition against Canada; the failure of any one of which
would have sufficed to frustrate your enterprise. It would
appear that heaven had decreed that France should lose
this colony. Let us now conclude, sir, that I have as little
deserved the blame, scorn, contempt and injustice which
my country heaped on my memory, as you do the excessive
honours they lavished on your’s in England; and that the
ablest General in Europe, placed in my circumstances,
could not have acted otherwise than I did. Moreover, I
was under M. de Vaudreuil&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;the weakest man alive, although
a most obstinate automaton&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;and could not freely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
follow my ideas as if I had been Commander-in-Chief. In
my country the law is equal: we neither punish, nor recompense.</p>

<p>The Marquis of Montcalm, endeavouring to rally the
troops in their disorderly flight, was wounded in the lower
part of the <span class="locked">belly.<a name="FNanchor_K" id="FNanchor_K" href="#Footnote_K" class="fnanchor">K</a></span> He was conveyed immediately to Quebec,
and lodged in the house of M. Arnoux, the King’s surgeon,
who was absent with M. de Bourlamarque: his
brother&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;the younger Arnoux&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;having viewed the wound,
declared it mortal. This truly great and worthy man heard
<span class="locked">Arnoux<a name="FNanchor_L" id="FNanchor_L" href="#Footnote_L" class="fnanchor">L</a></span> pronounce his sentence of death with a firm and
undaunted soul: his mind calm and serene; his countenance
soft and pleasing; and with a look of indifference
whether he lived or died. He begged of Arnoux to be so
kind and outspoken as to tell him how many hours he
thought he might yet live? Arnoux answered him, that
he might hold out until three in the morning. He spent
that short period of life in conversing with a few officers
upon indifferent subjects with great coolness and presence
of mind, and ended his days about the hour Arnoux had
foretold him. His last words were:&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;“I <span class="locked">die<a name="FNanchor_M" id="FNanchor_M" href="#Footnote_M" class="fnanchor">M</a></span> content,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
since I leave the affairs of the King, my dear master, in
good hands: I always had a high opinion of the talents
of M. de Levis.” I will not undertake the panegyric of
this great man: a true patriot and lover of his king and
country, possessing many rare and good qualities. Had he
by chance been born in England, his memory would have
been celebrated, and transmitted with honour to posterity.
Illustrious by his virtue and genius, he deserves to live in
history; he was an unfortunate victim to the insatiable
avarice of some men, and a prey to the immoderate ambition
of others. His ashes, mingled with those of Indians,
repose neglected far from his native country, without a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
magnificent tomb or altars; General Wolfe has statues in
England in commemoration of the many faults he committed
during his expedition in Canada. “How many obscure
dead,” says a modern author, “have received the greatest
honours by titles yet more vain? O injustice of mankind!
The mausolea adorn the temples to repeat continually false
praise; and history, which ought to be the sacred asylum
of truth, shows that statues and panegyrics are almost always
the monuments of prejudice, and that flattery seeks to
immortalise unjust reputations.”</p>

<p>When I was informed of M. de Montcalm’s misfortune, I
sent him immediately his servant Joseph, begging him to
acquaint me if I could be of any service to him, and in that
case I would be with him at Quebec immediately. Joseph
came back in a moment to the hornwork, and grieved me
to the inmost of my soul by M. de Montcalm’s answer:
“that it was needless to come to him, as he had only a few
hours to live, and he advised me to keep with Poularies
until the arrival of M. de Levis at the army.” Thus perished
a great man, generally unknown and unregretted by
his countrymen&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;a man who would have become the idol
and ornament of any other country in Europe.</p>

<p>The French army in flight, scattered and entirely dispersed,
rushed towards the town. Few of them entered
Quebec; they went down the heights of Abraham, opposite
to the Intendant’s Palace (past St. John’s gate) directing
their course to the hornwork, and following the borders of
the River St. Charles. Seeing the impossibility of rallying
our troops, I determined myself to go down the hill at the
windmill, near the <span class="locked">bakehouse,<a name="FNanchor_P" id="FNanchor_P" href="#Footnote_P" class="fnanchor">P</a></span> and from thence across
over the meadows to the hornwork, resolved not to approach
Quebec, from my apprehension of being shut up there with
a part of our army, which might have been the case if the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
victors had drawn all the advantage they could have reaped
from our defeat. It is true the death of the general-in-chief&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;an
event which never fails to create the greatest disorder
and confusion in an army&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;may plead as an excuse
for the English neglecting so easy an operation as to take
all our army prisoners.</p>

<p>But, instead of following immediately my ideas, I was
carried off by the flow of the fugitives, without being
able to stop them or myself until I got to a hollow swampy
ground, where some gunners were endeavouring to save a
field-piece which stuck there, and I stayed an instant with
them to encourage them to draw it to the town. Returning
back upon the rising ground, I was astonished to find
myself in the centre of the English army, who had advanced
whilst I was in the hollow with the gunners, and taking
me for a general, on account of my fine black horse,
they treated me as such by saluting me with a thousand
musket shots from half of the front of their army, which
had formed a crescent. I was, nevertheless, bent on reaching
the windmill, and I escaped their terrible fire without
any other harm than four balls through my clothes, which
shattered them; a ball lodged in the pommel of my saddle,
and four balls in my horse’s body, who lived, notwithstanding
his wounds, until he had carried me to the hornwork.</p>

<p>It is impossible to imagine the disorder and confusion
that I found in the <span class="locked">hornwork.<a name="FNanchor_Q" id="FNanchor_Q" href="#Footnote_Q" class="fnanchor">Q</a></span> The dread and consternation
was general. M. de Vaudreuil listened to everybody,
and was always of the advice of he who spoke last. No
order was given with reflection and with coolness, none
knowing what to order or what to do. When the English
had repulsed the two hundred Canadians that had gone up
the height at the same time that I came down from it, pursuing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
them down to the bakehouse, our men lost their
heads entirely; they became demoralized, imagining that
the English troops, then at the bakehouse, would in an
instant cross the plain and fly over the St. Charles river
into the hornwork as with wings. It is certain that when
fear once seizes hold of men it not only deprives them totally
of their judgment and reflection, but also of the use
of their eyes and their ears, and they become a thousand
times worse than the brute creation, guided by instinct
only, or by that small portion of reason which the author
of nature has assigned it, since it preserves the use of it on
all occasions. How much inferior to them do the greater
portion of mankind appear, with their boasted reason, when
reduced to madness and automata, on occasions when they
require the more the use of their reason.</p>

<p>The hornwork had the River St. Charles before it, about
seventy paces broad, which served it better than an artificial
ditch; its front, facing the river and the heights, was
composed of strong, thick, and high palisades, planted perpendicularly,
with gunholes pierced for several pieces of
large cannon in it; the river is deep and only fordable at
low water, at a musket shot before the fort. This made it
more difficult to be forced on that side than on its other
side of earthworks facing Beauport, which had a more
formidable appearance; and the hornwork certainly on
that side was not in the least danger of being taken by the
English, by an assault from the other side of the river. On
the appearance of the English troops on the plain of the
bakehouse, Montguet and La Motte, two old captains in
the Regiment of Bearn, cried out with vehemence to M. de
Vaudreuil, “that the hornwork would be taken in an instant,
by an assault, sword in hand; that we would be all
cut to pieces without quarter, and that nothing else would
save us but an immediate and general capitulation of Canada,
giving it up to the English.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
Montreuil told them that “a fortification such as the
hornwork was not to be taken so easily.” In short, there
arose a general cry in the hornwork to cut the bridge of
<span class="locked">boats.<a name="FNanchor_R" id="FNanchor_R" href="#Footnote_R" class="fnanchor">R</a></span> It is worthy of remark, that not a fourth of our
army had yet arrived at it, and the remainder, by cutting
the bridge, would have been left on the other side of the
river as victims to the victors. The regiment ‘Royal Roussillon’
was at that moment at the distance of a musket shot
from the hornwork, approaching to pass the bridge. As I
had already been in such adventures, I did not lose my
presence of mind, and having still a shadow remaining of
that regard, which the army accorded me on account of
the esteem and confidence which M. de Levis and M. de
Montcalm had always shown me publicly, I called to M.
Hugon, who commanded, for a pass in the hornwork, and
begged of him to accompany me to the bridge. We ran
there, and without asking who had given the order to cut
it, we chased away the soldiers with their uplifted axes
ready to execute that extravagant and wicked operation.</p>

<p>M. de Vaudreuil was closeted in a house in the inside of
the hornwork with the Intendant and with some other persons.
I suspected they were busy drafting the articles for
a general capitulation, and I entered the house, where I had
only time to see the Intendant with a pen in his hand
writing upon a sheet of paper, when M. de Vaudreuil told
me I had no business there. Having answered him that
what he said was true, I retired immediately, in wrath, to
see them intent on giving up so scandalously a dependency
for the preservation of which so much blood and treasure
had been expended. On leaving the house, I met M.
Dalquier, an old, brave, downright honest man, commander
of the regiment of Bearn, with the true character
of a good officer&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;the marks of Mars all over his body. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
told him it was being debated within the house, to give
up Canada to the English by a capitulation, and I hurried
him in to stand up for the King’s cause, and advocate the
welfare of his country. I then quitted the hornwork to
join Poularies at the <span class="locked">Ravine<a name="FNanchor_S" id="FNanchor_S" href="#Footnote_S" class="fnanchor">S</a></span> of Beauport; but having met
him about three or four hundred paces from the hornwork,
on his way to it, I told him what was being discussed
there. He answered me, that sooner than consent to a capitulation,
he would shed the last drop of his blood. He
told me to look on his table and house as my own, advised
me to go there directly to repose myself, and clapping spurs
to his horse, he flew like lightning to the hornwork.</p>

<p>As Poularies was an officer of great bravery, full of honour
and of rare merit, I was then certain that he and Dalquier
would break up the measures of designing men.
Many motives induced me to act strenuously for the good of
the service; amongst others, my gratitude for the Sovereign
who had given me bread; also, my affection and inviolable
friendship for M. de Levis in his absence, who
was now Commander-in-Chief of the French armies in
Canada by the death of M. de Montcalm. I continued sorrowfully
jogging on to Beauport, with a very heavy heart
for the loss of my dear friend, M. de Montcalm, sinking
with weariness and lost in reflection upon the changes
which Providence had brought about in the space of three
or four hours.</p>

<p>Poularies came back to his lodgings at Beauport about two
in the afternoon, and he brought me the agreeable news of
having converted the project of a capitulation into a retreat
to Jacques-Cartier, there to wait the arrival of M. de Levis;
and they despatched a courier immediately to Montreal to
inform him of our misfortune at Quebec, which, to all appearance,
would not have happened to us if M. de Vaudreuil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
had not sent him away, through some political reason, to
command there, without troops except those who were
with M. de Bourlamarque at L’Isle aux Noix&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;an officer of
great knowledge. The departure of the army was agreed
upon to be at night, and all the regiments were ordered to
their respective encampments until further orders. The
decision for a retreat was to be kept a great secret, and not
even communicated to the officers. I passed the afternoon
with Poularies, hoping each moment to receive from Montreuil&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;Major-General
of the army&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;the order of the retreat
for the regiment Royal Roussillon; but having no word of
it at eight o’clock in the evening, and it being a dark night,
Poularies sent his Adjutant to M. de Vaudreuil to receive his
orders for the left. Poularies instantly returned to inform
him that the right of our army was gone away with M. de
Vaudreuil without his having given any orders concerning
the retreat, and that they followed the highway to the hornwork.
Castaigné, his Adjutant, could give no further account
of this famous retreat, only that all the troops on our
right were marched off. It can be easily imagined how
much we were confounded by this ignorant and stupid conduct,
which can scarce appear credible to the most ignorant
military man.</p>

<p>Poularies sent immediately to inform the post next to his
regiment of the retreat, with orders to acquaint all the left
of it, from post to post, between Beauport and the Sault de
Montmorency.</p>

<p>I then set out with him and his regiment, following those
before us as the other posts to our left followed us, without
any other guides, orders or instructions with regard to the
roads we should take, or where we should go to; this was
left to chance, or at least was a secret which M. de Vaudreuil
kept to himself <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">in petto</i>. It was a march entirely in
the Indian manner; not a retreat, but a horrid, abominable
flight, a thousand times worse than that in the morning upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
the heights of Abraham, with such disorder and confusion
that, had the English known it, three hundred men
sent after us would have been sufficient to destroy and cut
all our army to pieces. Except the regiment Royal Roussillon,
which Poularies, always a rigid and severe disciplinarian,
kept together in order, there were not to be seen thirty
soldiers together of any other regiment. They were all mixed,
scattered, dispersed, and running as hard as they could,
as if the English army was at their heels. There never was
a more favourable position to make a beautiful, well-combined
retreat, in bright day, and in sight of the English
Army looking at us, without having the smallest reason to
fear anything within their power to oppose it, as I had obtained
a perfect knowledge of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">locale</i> from Beauport to
the Sault de Montmorency during some months that I was
there constantly with M. de Levis and M. de Montcalm. I
thought myself in a position to foretell to Poularies the
probable order of retreat, and the route which would be assigned
to each regiment for their march to the Lorette village.
I was greatly deceived, and indeed could never have
foreseen the route which our entire army followed to reach
Lorette, and which prolonged our march prodigiously for
the centre of our army, and still more for our left at the
Sault de Montmorency. There is a highway in a straight
line from the Sault de Montmorency to Lorette, which
makes a side of a triangle formed by another highway from
the Sault to Quebec, and by another road from Lorette to
the hornwork, which formed the base. In the highway
from the Sault to the hornwork there are eight or nine cross
roads of communication from it to the road from the Sault
to Lorette, which are shorter as they approach to the point
of the angle at the Sault. Thus it was natural to believe
that our army, being encamped all along the road from the
Sault to the hornwork, each regiment would have taken
one of these cross roads, the nearest to his encampment, in
order to take the straight road from the Sault to Lorette,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
instead of coming to the hornwork to take there the road
from Quebec to Lorette, by which the left had double the
distance to march, besides being more liable by approaching
the hornwork so near to the English, to make them discover
the retreat.</p>

<p>The army, by this operation, would have arrived all at
the same time in the road from the Sault to Lorette by the
difference in the length of these cross roads, and would have
naturally formed a column all along that road; and as it
was not a forced retreat, they had the time from twelve at
noon until eight at night to send off all the baggage by
cross roads to Lorette, without the English perceiving it;
but supposing them even fully aware of our design, which
might have been executed in open day, they no way could
disturb our operations without attacking the hornwork,
and attempting the passage of the river St. Charles&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;a very
difficult and dangerous affair&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;where they might be easily
repulsed, exposing themselves in a moment to lose the
fruits of their victory, without enjoying it; and consequently
they would have been insane had they ventured on such
a rash enterprise. Instead of these wise measures, which
common sense alone might have dictated, tents, artillery, the
military stores, baggage, and all other effects, were left as a
present to the English; the officers saved only a few shirts,
or what they could carry in their pockets: the rest was lost.
In fact, it would appear, by this strange conduct, that a
class of men there, from interested views, were furiously
bent on giving up the colony to the English, so soon as they
could have a plausible pretext to colour their designs,&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;by
lopping off gradually all the means possible to defend it any
longer. M. de Vaudreuil had still other kind offices in
reserve for the English. He wrote to de Ramsay, King’s
Lieutenant and Commander in <span class="locked">Quebec,<a name="FNanchor_T" id="FNanchor_T" href="#Footnote_T" class="fnanchor">T</a></span> as soon as the retreat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
was decided:&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;“That he might propose a capitulation
for the town eight-and-forty hours after the departure
of our army from our camp at Beauport, upon the best
conditions he could obtain from the English.” We ran
along in flight all night; and at daybreak M. de Bougainville,
with his detachment, joined us near Cap Rouge. In
the evening, our army arrived at Pointe-aux-Trembles&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;five
leagues from Quebec&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;where it passed the night, and next
day came to Jacques-Cartier. The English had so little
suspicion of our retreat, seeing our tents standing without
any change at our camp, that Belcour&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;an officer of La
Rochebaucourt’s cavalry&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;having returned to it with a detachment,
two days after our flight, he found everything
the same as when we left it. He went into the hornwork
with his detachment, and fired the guns (pointed) at the
heights of Abraham towards the English camp, which
greatly alarmed them.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_M" id="Footnote_M" href="#FNanchor_M" class="fnanchor">M</a> The place where Montcalm died appears yet shrouded in doubt. It is
stated, in Knox’s Journal, that, on being wounded, Montcalm was conveyed
to the General Hospital, towards which the French squadrons in retreat had to
pass to regain, over the bridge of boats, their camp at Beauport. The General
Hospital was also the head-quarters of the wounded&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;both English and French.
It has been supposed that Arnoux’s house, where Montcalm was conveyed,
stood in St. Louis street. No where does it appear that Montcalm was conveyed
to his own residence on the ramparts (on which now stands the residence
of R.&nbsp;H. Wurtele, Esquire). As the city surrendered five days after the
great battle, it was likely to be bombarded&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;and, moreover, one-third of the
houses in it had been burnt and destroyed&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;we do not see why the wounded
General should have been conveyed from the battle-field to the Château St.
Louis&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;certainly an exposed situation in the event of a new bombardment;
and, moreover, the city itself, after and during the battle, was considered so
insecure that the French army, instead of retreating to it for shelter, hurried
past the General Hospital, over the bridge, to their camp at Beauport. There
is a passage in Lieutenant-Colonel Beatson’s Notes on the Plains of Abraham,
which we give:&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;“The valiant Frenchman (Montcalm), regardless of pain, relaxed
not his efforts to rally his broken battalions in their hurried retreat
towards the city until he was shot through the loins, when within a few
hundred yards of St. Louis <span class="locked">Gate.<a name="FNanchor_N" id="FNanchor_N" href="#Footnote_N" class="fnanchor">N</a></span> And so invincible was his fortitude
that not even the severity of this mortal stroke could abate his gallant spirit
or alter his intrepid bearing. Supported by two grenadiers&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;one at each
side of his horse&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;he re-entered the city; and in reply to some women who,
on seeing blood flow from his wounds as he rode down St. Louis street, on
his way to the Château, exclaimed: <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Oh, mon Dieu! mon Dieu! le Marquis
est tuê!!!</i> he courteously assured them that he was not seriously hurt, and
begged of them not to distress themselves on his account.&#8203;&mdash;&#8203;<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Ce n’est rien! ce
n’est rien! Ne vous affligez pas pour moi, mes bonnes amies.</i>”<a name="FNanchor_O" id="FNanchor_O" href="#Footnote_O" class="fnanchor">O</a></p></div>

troops and preserve order in the retreat, was also mortally wounded in the loins by a
musket-ball. He was at that moment between <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Les Buttes-a-Neveu</i> and St. Louis Gate.”
From the city, on the one side, and from the battle-field, on the other, the ground rises until
the two slopes meet and form a ridge; the summit of which was formerly occupied by a
windmill belonging to a man named <i>Neveu</i> or <i>Nepveu</i>. About midway between this ridge
and St. Louis Gate, and to the southward of the St. Louis Road, are some slight eminences,
still known by the older French residents as <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Les Buttes-a-Nepveu</i> or <i>Neveu’s hillocks</i>, and
